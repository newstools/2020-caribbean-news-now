Aruba launches One Happy Workation Program				




Aruba launches “One Happy Workation” program, inviting valid US passport holders to stay and work remotely in Aruba from one week up to 90 days.



One Happy Workation offers a collection of deals and discounted rates at t local hotels, chain resorts, and rental homes.














The program does not require any visas or any type of official documentation from the Aruban government prior to arrival.



“We recognize the desire to travel safely and have noticed a rising trend of visitors in Aruba extending their stays, so we knew the appetite for longer trips was growing,” said Sanju Luidens, the CMO of the Aruba Tourism Authority.



Remote workers are free to work anywhere on the island, but must be employed or self-employed in their home country. They will not be permitted to work for an Aruban company or individual, as this requires a work or business permit. 



From September 24, US travelers from certain States will be required to submit COVID-19 tests prior to arrival as well as upon landing is required. 



Visitors will then have to quarantine at their accommodations until they obtain their test results, which Aruba’s tourism board says usually takes between six and eight hours.



All visitors must also purchase Aruba Visitors Insurance, which is meant to cover any COVID-19-related costs incurred during their stay. 



The government also reminded visitors that wearing of face masks are mandatory in indoor public spaces, including in shops and on tour buses. 



Restaurants are open, but bars, rum shops, and nightclubs remain closed. Hotel bars, however, have been allowed to open for hotel guests only.
