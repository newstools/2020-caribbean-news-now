PAHO: “Start planning for COVID-19 vaccinations”				




Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) Director, Carissa Etienne urges countries around the world to start planning for COVID-19 vaccinations and must continue to implement other recommended public health measures to contain the virus.



“If we don’t prepare now, we will miss the opportunity to benefit from it quickly. The truth is, countries cannot wait to have all of the answers before they start planning and preparing to deliver a COVID vaccine.”



In a news briefing today, Etienne noted the importance of identifying the most vulnerable individuals and making sure they get vaccinated first.



“The goal of early vaccination could be to reduce deaths and suffering from this virus and to minimize the risk of infection while protecting our health systems overall. And that’s why it is recommended that frontline health workers, first responders and those caring for the elderly would be vaccinated first, followed by vulnerable groups such as adults with preexisting conditions, especially those over 65 years of age.”



The PAHO Director emphasised the need to “work together” adding that we cannot rely on the vaccine alone to curb the COVID-19 pandemic.



“We believe that the COVAX Facility, convened by Gavi, CEPI and WHO, will afford countries in our region the best opportunity to fast-track access to COVID-19 vaccines and to reduce the impact of the pandemic on people’s lives and our economies. The COVAX facility offers access to a basket of 15 possible vaccines.” 



Etienne likewise said that PAHO is well prepared to offer technical cooperation to countries so they can prepare and implement their vaccination campaigns – from planning and forecasting to communications, from regulations to the training of health personnel. Another benefit to our member states is that they can rely on our Revolving Fund, the biggest regional mechanism for self-financing countries, for the purchase and delivery of vaccines.
