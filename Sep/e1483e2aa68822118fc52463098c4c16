UN Chief: Stand together and build a just world #IDP2020				




UN Secretary-General António Guterres asked everyone to stand together to build a just and peaceful world even amid the upheaval of the COVID-19 pandemic.



Guterres made the appeal in his message to mark the International Day of Peace.



He described the deadly virus as a “common enemy” that is causing immense suffering, destroying livelihoods and exacerbating already formidable peace and security challenges. 



“In these days of physical distancing, we may not be able to stand next to one another. But we must still stand together for peace. And, together, I know we can — and will — build a more just, sustainable, and equitable world.”



The UN General Assembly established the International Day in 1981, and two decades later unanimously designated it as a period of non-violence and ceasefire. 



This year, the focus is on “Shaping Peace Together.”   



“In that spirit, and to mark our 75th anniversary, the United Nations is bringing people together for a global conversation about shaping our future and forging peace in trying times,” said the Secretary-General, speaking about the UN75 initiative. 



With the pandemic continuing its relentless march across the world, the UN chief underlined the importance of having warring parties lay down their weapons and work for harmony.
