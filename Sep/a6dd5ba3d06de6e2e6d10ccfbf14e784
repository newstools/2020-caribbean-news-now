JetBlue expands across the Caribbean				




JetBlue announced the addition of more than half a dozen new routes across the Caribbean region beginning November 2020.



The expansion includes new flights from Newark International Airport to six Caribbean countries namely Aruba, Jamaica, Dominican Republic, Sint Maarten, The Bahamas and Turks and Caicos as well as flights from North Carolina’s Raleigh–Durham International Airport to Montego Bay, Jamaica.



JetBlue’s Caribbean expansion is among the 24 new routes that will be launched later this year.



The added flights will have a significant impact on the regional development and will become instrumental in restarting tourism activity across the region.



“This is the latest example of JetBlue’s ability to be nimble and play offense as we quickly adjust to new customer behaviors and booking patterns,” said Scott Laurence, head of revenue and planning, JetBlue. 



JetBlue will reactivate some temporarily parked aircraft to support the new routes. Alongside the rest of the JetBlue network, these new markets will be regularly evaluated. The airline will remain flexible, allowing market demand to determine how long a particular route continues to operate.



The announcement is the latest in a series of strategic moves JetBlue has made to accelerate its recovery and generate cash in the current travel environment. 



In June, JetBlue announced it would add 30 new domestic routes to serve customers in markets where leisure and VFR (visiting friends and relatives) travel is showing some signs of strength.
