Colorado reports case of COVID-19 variant				




Governor Jared Polis reported that Colorado has its first case of the COVID-19 variant seen in the United Kingdom.



The variant was found in a man in his 20s who has no travel history. He was place in isolation in southeast of Denver in Elbert County.



Another suspected case was reported according to health authorities. 



The Colorado State Laboratory confirmed the virus variant, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was notified.



Scientists in the U.K. believe the variant is more contagious than previously identified strains. The vaccines being given now are thought to be effective against the variant, Colorado health officials said in a news release.



“There is a lot we don’t know about this new COVID-19 variant, but scientists in the United Kingdom are warning the world that it is significantly more contagious. The health and safety of Coloradans is our top priority, and we will closely monitor this case, as well as all COVID-19 indicators, very closely,” Governor Polis said.



Contact tracing is being conducted to determine the spread of the variant throughout Colorado.



The discovery of the new variant led the CDC to issue new rules on Christmas Day for travelers arriving to the U.S. from the U.K., requiring they show proof of a negative COVID-19 test.



More than a dozen countries have barred flights from the U.K., and southern England was placed under strict lockdown measures. Scientists say there is a reason for concern but the new strains should not cause alarm.



The U.K. variant, known as B.1.1.7, has also been found in Canada, Italy, India and the United Arab Emirates.



South Africa has also discovered a highly contagious COVID-19 variant, known as 501.V2, causing the latest spike of active cases and deaths.
