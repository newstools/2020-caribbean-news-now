Queen Elizabeths’ low-key birthday ceremony				




This year’s official birthday of Queen Elizabeth II was marked with a new low-key ceremony on because of the COVID-19 pandemic.



In line with Government advice, it was agreed that the Queen’s birthday parade, also known as Trooping the Colour, would not go ahead in its traditional form. Thus, a small and brief, military ceremony took place in accordance with strict social distancing guidelines.



The ceremonial tribute, dubbed a mini-Trooping, was performed by a small number of Welsh Guardsmen and the band of the Household Division.



Today’s event took place entirely within the confines of Windsor Castle, with no viewing positions for the public. The ceremony lasted around 20 minutes with BBC One covering the event live. 











Major General Christopher Ghika, who commands the Household Division, said the circumstances surrounding the decision to host the tribute in Windsor were “clouded in tragedy”.



“The effects of Covid-19 have been devastating in terms of loss of life and the threatening of livelihoods of so many across the country.”



General Ghika added that the Welsh Guards and many of those on parade have recently been deployed within the United Kingdom as part of the nation’s response to the virus, making the context of the ceremony is particularly poignant.



The ceremony concluded with a second royal salute, following which the Guards and Band exited the Quadrangle and the monarch departed.  



It is only the second time in her 68-year reign that the parade in London has not gone ahead. This year’s celebration is also the first held at Windsor Castle.



The queen’s actual birthday is April 21, but it is officially and publicly celebrated annually every second Saturday of June.



Earlier this week, Buckingham Palace released a new photograph of the royal couple to celebrate Philip’s birthday.
