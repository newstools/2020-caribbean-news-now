New curfew for BVI amid COVID-19				




Starting Sunday, 10th May, the British Virgin Islands (BVI) will have a new curfew schedule amid the threat of COVID-19 in the island.



During a contact signing, Premier Andrew Fahie announced that the new curfew hours will run during night-time hours from 7:00 PM to 6:00 AM for 14 days.



“Just to reassure the public of how serious we are about the reopening, of course, being mindful of the health pandemic that we are fighting; Cabinet on May 4, in order to restore more confidence in our economy while the reopening and the rebooting is taking place, has made a decision that the next phase of the internal reopening for our economy will start on Sunday, May 10.”



BVI’s current curfew runs from 1:00 PM to 6:00 AM daily.



With the changes in the curfew hours, all government-approved businesses including construction companies can operate during daytime.







COVID-19 in BVI increases



BVI Ministry of Health has recorded another positive COVID-19 case, bringing the total confirmed cases in the territory to seven.



In a broadcast, Minister for Health Carvin Malone said that 21 samples were sent to the Caribbean Public Health Agency (CARPHA) in Trinidad for testing and one returned positive for COVID-19.



“Case Number-seven is linked to a previously detected case. It was quarantined and had tested negative on the first protocol of testing. It is common that in early stages of the infection the virus that causes COVID-19 could go undetected.”



The Health Minister did not reveal the gender or age of the latest case but said the patient has presented only mild symptoms and will be continuously kept in isolation.



Of the seven COVID-19 cases in BVI, there are three active cases, three recoveries and one death.



He urged the public to call the medical hotline (852-7650) if experiencing any flu-like symptoms as well as breathing difficulties.



Malone added that no island nation can be safe until each of the territories are deemed COVID-19 free.







Coronavirus’ economic impact in BVI



The British Virgin Islands reports the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the territory.



In a statement, Minister of Labour Vincent Wheatley said COVID-19 has brought about changes in the way of life, which many never thought would happen.



Wheatley disclosed that approximately 77 Businesses have contacted the Department of Labour and Workforce Development – with the tourism industry being hit the hardest.



“Approximately 33 of these have reported closure, and approximately 683 have been reported laid off; some persons have been reassigned or reclassified as it relates to position and/or salary, and approximately 72 persons have been terminated throughout the Territory.  Of the approximate 1300 employees reported as affected, 425 are BVIslanders/Belongers; 493 are Work Permit Holders; 80 are Work Permit Exempt; and over 330 of those persons are still being classified.”



The minister had appealed to all affected businesses who have not yet reported their status to the Labour and the Immigration Department to do so the soonest.



“I want to remind business owners and employees that your ability to report your business and employment status to the Department of Labour & Workforce Development and the Immigration Department will assist the Government in making sure the stimulus plan takes you who have been affected into account. Such data is critical to our decision making as a Government. We need you to be active participants in this process.”



Meanwhile, Wheatley reminded all persons or businesses wishing to visit the departments to first call and book an appointment through the following numbers:
