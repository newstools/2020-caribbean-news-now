St. Kitts’ Revised COVID-19 regulations				




The Government of St. Kitts and Nevis announced a revised SR&O No. 16 of 2020 known as Emergency Powers COVID-19 Regulations. 



 In a nationally televised address to the nation, Prime Minister Timothy Harris announced that there will now be five days of limited business operations and revised curfew hours.



“From Monday, 11th May and every day next week to Friday, 15th May, businesses will enjoy an additional day of limited operations as long as they practice social distancing and physical distancing protocols. The Regulations will also provide for a similar pattern to be followed during the week beginning Monday, 18th May to Friday 22nd May that is there will be 5 days of limited business operations from Monday to Friday.”



Meanwhile, on weekends the country will observe a 24-hour curfew, or a total lock down.



Additionally, the prime minister announced that his Government will extend the day of limited operations to 8:00 pm instead of 7:00 pm to allow businesses to have an additional hour in the evening.



“Where businesses would have closed at 5:00 pm to allow customers and staff to conform to the 7:00 pm start of the nightly curfew, they can now close to the public at 6:00 pm. Businesses will not only have a five-day workweek to operate but an additional hour as well on each day of limited business operations. These Regulations will continue the process of gradually opening our Federation to more economic and social activity.”



As the Government looks to encourage more economic activity and as we return to a semblance of normalcy, Prime Minister Harris called on businesses to provide for a sanitized environment and insist that their staff and customers wear face masks.



“No one should be out in public without wearing a mask or article covering his or her nose and mouth.”
