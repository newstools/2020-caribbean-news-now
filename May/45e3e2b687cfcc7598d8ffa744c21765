WHO Guidelines For Mass Gatherings Amid Pandemic				




As countries move towards establishing normalcy, World Health Organization (WHO) issued guidelines on mass gatherings amid the COVID-19 pandemic. 



The World Health Organization recommends a number of possible changes to large events like inviting only healthy people, once they are allowed to take place.



“In the context of COVID-19, mass gatherings are events that could amplify the transmission of the virus and potentially disrupt the host country’s response capacity,” the guidance said. But it said large events offered benefits, too, such as providing employment and boosting psychological well-being.







“Since mass gatherings have substantial political, cultural, social, and economic implications, authorities should assess the importance and necessity of an event and consider the option that it may take place, provided all associated public health risks are adequately addressed and mitigated.”







The WHO also called on public health authorities and event organizers to perform a risk assessment before any gathering and listed a number of steps organizers could take if large events do occur, such as:



Staggering arrivalsIncreasing the frequency of transportDesignating seatingVenue capacity could also be adjustedEvents could be held virtually or outdoors



Some recommendations focused on participants, reminding people to observe physical distancing, cough etiquette and hand hygiene practices.



People at risk of developing severe illness – including those over the age of 65 or with pre-existing medical conditions – could be advised to stay away, or special arrangements could be made for them.



The WHO recommendations included a number of other measures as well, such as limiting the duration of events and providing on-site isolation facilities for people who become sick.



In the latest data of Johns Hopkins University, there are over 6 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 across the globe with more almost 370,000 recorded deaths.
