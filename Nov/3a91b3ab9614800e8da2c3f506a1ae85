Dominica revises COVID-19 country risk classification				




The Government of Dominica has taken a responsible decision to revise the COVID-19 Country Risk Classifications for travel from the CARICOM Travel Bubble – Low, Medium and High-Risk Countries.



Effective Wednesday November 18, 2020, St. Lucia has been reclassified to the HIGH RISK classification.



With the new classification, travellers from St. Lucia to Dominica must submit the online health screening form. The form is downloadable at https://domcovid19.dominica.gov.dm/. The traveller should also present a Negative PCR test taken within 24-72 hours prior to arrival in Dominica.



Upon exiting the port of entry, travelers will submit to a quarantine period of up to 7 days where a PCR test is taken on day 5 after arrival. Results are expected within 24-48 hours.



Traveler/s will likewise undergo mandatory quarantine and may opt to quarantine at the Government operated facility or at a Safe in Nature Certified property under a “Managed Experience”.



The Safe in Nature Commitment and Managed Experiences are available to all visitors, including guests from high risk classified countries visiting Dominica.



More information about the Safe in Nature Commitment and Managed Experiences and a complete listing of the risk classification of countries is available at https://discoverdominica.com/travel-advisory-for-dominica.



Discover Dominica Authority continues to work with Health Officials to ensure the safety and security of visitors to the island and with tourism stakeholders to ensure a unique managed experience in a responsible manner.
