Scotland announces countries exempted from quarantine				




Scotland has announced its list of 57 countries exempt from mandatory two-week quarantine upon arrival into the country.



The list is similar to UK’s Travel Corridor Exemption released earlier this week, minus Spain and Serbia.



Travel industry leaders in the country asked the Scottish government to include Spain on that list, citing that 60% of leisure flight arrivals are from Spain.



“It’s important we work quickly to bring the travel advice issued today in line with the rest of the UK. We’ve requested a meeting with the Scottish Government to discuss what further measures could be put in place that would allow the lifting of restrictions and prevent airlines from cancelling routes to what is one of Scotland’s most popular and important tourism destinations,” said Derek Provan, CEO of AGS Airports to insider.co.uk



However, the Scottish government said that it cannot lift the restrictions on people arriving from Spain and Serbia due to the higher prevalence of COVID-19 and a recent outbreak respectively in the two countries.



From 10 July, the quarantine for those arriving in Scotland will not be imposed if they come from countries included in the travel corridor list. 



Those who have stopped off in a country not on the list will still be required to self-isolate for two weeks, as will travellers arriving into Scotland via an English port or airport if they have been in a country which is not on the exemption list.



All inbound travellers, whether visitors or UK residents, must provide a passenger locator form before their arrival into the country.



The measure is not necessarily reciprocal; for example, although travellers won’t have to self-isolate when returning from New Zealand, there is very little chance of them gaining entry there in the first place.



The list of exempt countries will be reviewed on 20 July.
