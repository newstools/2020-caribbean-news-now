100 days of COVID-19				




The pandemic



100 days after the first case was reported to the World Health Organisation from Wuhan, China, COVID-19 has spread across the globe at an immense rate.



Three and a half months on, there are more than 1.4 million confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 300,000 recoveries in 184 countries.



Of those confirmed cases, deaths are a little over than 82,000, a fatality rate of about 6 per cent.



Life has turned upside down in the past 100 days since the onset of the pandemic.



Global lockdowns have made the once-bustling roads, busy airports, crowded parks, and other public places silent and empty.
