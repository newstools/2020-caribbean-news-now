Use of cloth face covers against COVID-19				




In light of recent studies that COVID-19 can spread between people interacting in close proximity, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies) and more so, in areas of significant community-based transmission.



In a release, CDC also advises the use of simple cloth face coverings that can be done at home using common materials.

Face covers, especially made with cloth, should be routinely washed depending on the frequency of use.



As added precaution, individuals should be careful not to touch their eyes, nose, and mouth when removing their face covering and wash hands immediately after removing.
