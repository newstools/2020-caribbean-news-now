St. Lucia implements 24-hr curfew for one week				




Prime Minister Allen Chastanet announced a 24-hour curfew for the entire St. Lucia for one week to curb cases of COVID-19.



“It has become absolutely necessary to elevate our State of Emergency to a 24-hour shutdown for the next 7 days, until April 7th, 2020. Every person shall be confined to their place of residence, inclusive of their personal yards.”



Chastanet made the announcement in a national address after confirming that there is now a “community spread” of the deadly coronavirus (COVID-19) in the island.



To date, 13 persons have tested positive for COVID-19 in Saint Lucia.



With the 24-hr curfew in place, an individual can only leave their place of residence upon written authorisation of the National Emergency Management Organisation (NEMO).



Persons with medical emergencies will also be allowed to leave their homes.



The government decided to close all supermarkets as well for the entire week.



“By allowing supermarkets to remain open, even if for just one more day, would defeat the purpose of social distancing as there will be a mass rush to purchase goods possibly allowing for further spread of the virus.”



The prime minister urged those in need of food and medical supplies to call the 311 COVID-19 hotline and get the relevant information.



He added that NEMO will be responsible for supplying food to the elderly and poor during this time.



“I understand that many of you may be uncomfortable with the sudden implementation of this decision, however, this temporary inconvenience is for the greater good of the entire nation. Contact information for NEMO is (758) 452-3802.”



Chastanet explained that the Cabinet had to make this decision based on the evidence at hand and recognizing the dilemma that St. Lucia is facing.

Farmers Worried About Food Security Amidst Shutdown



With the full shutdown mode for 7 days, St. Lucian farmers are in a state of uncertainty.



In a report, one farmer said that not being able to water crops in the farms would result to dying of crops.



The farmer added that this will greatly affect the agricultural industry and affect food security in the country.



Farmers are also willing to donate their boxes of produces to NEMO for distribution.
