Dominica’s “Safe in Nature” campaign				




The Nature Island of Dominica has launched its “Safe in Nature” tourism campaign aimed to provide a safe experience to visitors amid the COVID-19 pandemic. 



The Safe in Nature commitment program is a result of the collective work of The Ministry of Tourism, International Transport and Maritime Initiatives, Discover Dominica Authority, Dominica Hotel and Tourism Association along with other tourism stakeholders, geared to revive the tourism industry. 



“To those thinking about travel, those thinking about visiting us to experience our rich cultural celebrations and cuisine, those needing a well-deserved break from chaos and crowds, those needing rejuvenation, we extend a warm invitation to Dominica where you, your family and friends will be Safe in Nature,” said Denise Charles, Dominica’s Minister of Tourism.



The program will ensure a managed experience throughout the first 5 –7 days of visitors arriving in Dominica. It also includes transportation services, stay at certified accommodation as well as provisions for leisure activities.











Dominica officially reopened for tourism in August, with many of the island’s top hotels, from Secret Bay to the new Kempinski, back open and welcoming guests. 



“Dominica is not only a vacation but a discovery — and travel to Dominica, especially now, can be transformative and the antidote to relieve the stress that many individuals are current feeling,” said Samantha Letang, marketing executive at the DDA.

Most Caribbean islands are now reopening their borders to start economic recovery after being hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.
