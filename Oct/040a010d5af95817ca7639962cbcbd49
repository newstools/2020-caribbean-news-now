General elections for St. Vincent and the Grenadines called				




The people of St. Vincent and the Grenadines will go to the polls on November 5 in a general election. Parliament will be dissolved today, and Nomination Day will be October 20.



Prime Minister Dr. Ralph Gonsalves who is seeking his fifth consecutive term, made the announcement during a virtual meeting of his ruling Unity Labour Party (ULP).



Gonsalves said on Thursday that he had gotten the inspiration from the bible for the election date.



“The 11th chapter of Deuteronomy represents for me in our circumstances, the 11th month of the year, November the fifth verse the fifth day. General elections will be held on Thursday, November the fifth 2020.”










We humbly and graciously ask for your support on Thursday, 5 November 2020.

Vincentians will vote two days after the United States goes to the polls in presidential elections.



ULP will go head to head with New Democratic Party (NDP), led by its leader Godwin Friday.



The leader of St. Vincent and the Grenadines’ main opposition New Democratic Party (NDP), Dr Godwin Friday, has welcomed the announcement of the November 5 date for the general elections in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, saying the party had been waiting five years for the opportunity to remove the ruling Unity Labour Party (ULP) from office.



“It is time for a change, my people. It is time to give me and the New Democratic Party and this outstanding, unprecedented team that we have put together to represent our people and to form a government and deliver our people.”



In the December 2015 general election, ULP won by an 8-7 margin, enjoying the same slender one-seat majority in the previous election.



Both political parties have suspended large-scale in-person public meetings because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
