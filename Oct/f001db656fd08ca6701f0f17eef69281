Grenada calls for change and greater accountability in the fisheries sector				




Grenada GIS – Prime Minister Dr. the Right Honourable Keith Mitchell, has called for structural changes and greater accountability in the fisheries sector.



Continuing his series of meetings with ministers and top ministry officials, Dr. Mitchell expressed his concern about the current state of the fisheries sector.



He said, “We have to be honest with ourselves, the fisheries sector needs a complete overhaul. The management system must change and we must ensure that there is a greater level of accountability. We know what the weaknesses are and we must take quick action to address those.”



The Prime Minister noted that effecting the necessary reforms in the sector will present a formidable challenge for the new Minister for Fisheries, Hon. Yolande Bain-Horsford and the Permanent Secretary responsible for Fisheries and Cooperatives, Mr Michael Stephen. 



Sharing some advice, Mitchell said, “When policy decisions are taken, we must move quickly to implement them. The sector needs urgent help and we must demonstrate our commitment to making the requisite improvements.”



The Prime Minister also cited the issue of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) as an area for quick action. 



He said, “We must regain our strategic direction where MPAs are concerned. There appears to be too much self-interest rather than doing what is best for the country as a whole. The MPA in Carriacou should serve as a model for what we should be doing in Grenada. It is well organised and providing the requisite service and we need to see that emulated across the country.”



Both the Minister and the Permanent Secretary have pledged their commitment to work collaboratively to bring about the necessary restructuring and revitalisation of the fisheries sector.
